The Great Field Of Midgaard~
   You are walking on a wide dirt path through the lush, green, fresh
Midgaard countryside.  You can see to the horizon to the north, east,
and west; the busy city of Midgaard lies to the south.  All around you
is healthy green grass and an occasional large oak tree.  The sun feels
wonderful on your face and a pleasant wind blows through your hair.  Birds
chirp quietly to themselves and you can smell the faint scent of flowers
and freshly cut grass.  You feel like you could lie down in the grass and
stay here forever, surrounded by powerful beauty in all directions.

lay untouched in the corners, collecting cobwebs.  Several large crates have
been pried open by curious customs agents, and are now stacked along the west

Faces of various known Killers and Thieves can barely be seen behind the
