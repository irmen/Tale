
The blankly staring person abruptly turns towards you and grabs you.
Their arms are strong. "Way too strong for a normal human being..." is the
last thing that crosses your mind, before they strangle you and everything
turns to black.


You unfortunately didn't manage to escape the town and its weird events this time.

Pay attention to the strange people wandering about. It's probably a good idea
to avoid them and flee or run away from them when they start attacking you.
Please try again keeping this in mind!
