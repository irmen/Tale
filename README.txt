Tale is 100% pure Python and runs on Python 2.7 and 3.2+.
It requires the smartypants library (for nicely quoted string output)
the colorama library (for colorized console output),
and the appdirs library (to load and save games in the correct folder).


Read the documentation for more details on how to get started.
