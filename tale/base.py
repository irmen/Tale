Every object that can hold other objects does so in its "inventory" (a set).
You can't access it directly, object.inventory returns a frozenset copy of it.
Except Location: it separates the items and livings it contains internally.
Use its enter/leave methods instead.

    Root class of all objects in the mud world
    All objects have an identifying short name (will be lowercased),
    an optional short title (shown when listed in a room),
    and an optional longer description (shown when explicitly 'examined').
    The long description is 'dedented' first, which means you can put it between triple-quoted-strings easily.
    Short_description is also optional, and is used in the text when a player 'looks' around.
    If it's not set, a generic 'look' message will be shown (something like "XYZ is here").

    Extra descriptions (extra_desc) are used to make stuff more interesting and interactive
    Extra descriptions are accessed by players when they type ``look at <thing>``
    where <thing> is any keyword you choose.  For example, you might write a room description which
    includes the tantalizing sentence, ``The wall looks strange here.``
    Using extra descriptions, players could then see additional detail by typing
    ``look at wall.``  There can be an unlimited number of Extra Descriptions.
